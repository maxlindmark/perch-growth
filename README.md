# Non-linear growth-temperature relationship leads to opposite response to warming in cold versus warm populations

This repo contains data and R code (Jan, Max) for collating and analyzing time series of back calculated length-at-age data on perch along a latitudinal and thermal gradient in the Baltic Sea (from database KUL: https://www.slu.se/institutioner/akvatiska-resurser/databaser/kul/ and SLU)

With [Anna GÃ¥rdmark](https://internt.slu.se/en/cv-originals/anna-gardmark/) and [Jan Ohlberger](http://janohlberger.com/Homepage/)

## How to replicate our analyses and navigate this repo

`data/for-analysis/` Contains merged and cleaned data size-at-age data. Temperature data will be made available.

`R/prepare-data` Scripts for cleaning and exploring size-at-age data and temperature data

`R/analyze-data` Scripts for fitting GLMMs with smooths (temperature) and von Bertalanffy models + Sharpe Schoolfield models to size-at-age data

`figures` Contains all main and supporting figures (`figures/supp`)

You can also download this repo and view knitted html files of all .qmd
